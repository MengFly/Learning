    "The first contribution of this paper is a new image representation called anintegral image that allows for very fast feature evaluation. Motivated in part by the work of Papageorgiou et al. our detection system does not work directly with image intensities [8]. Like these authors we use a set of features which are reminiscent of Haar Basis functions (though we will also use related filters which are more complex than Haar filters). In order to compute these features very rapidly at many scales we introduce the integral image representation for images (the integral image is very similar to the summed area table used in computer graphics [2] for texture mapping). The integral image can be computed from an image using a few operations per pixel. Once computed, any one of these Harr-like features can be computed at any scale or location in constanttime.<br>\n",

    "The second contribution of this paper is a method for constructing a classifier by selecting a small number of important features using AdaBoost [4]. Within any image sub-window the total number of Harr-like features is very large, far larger than the number of pixels. In order to ensure fast classification, the learning process must exclude a large majority of the available features, and focus on a small set of critical features. Motivated by the work of Tieu and Viola, feature selection is achieved through a simple modification of the AdaBoost procedure: the weak learner is constrained so that each weak classifier returned can depend on only a single feature [17]. As a result each stage of the boosting process, which selects a new weak classifier, can be viewed as a feature selection process. AdaBoost provides an effective learning algorithm and strong bounds on generalization performance [12, 7, 8].<br>\n",
    "本文的第二个贡献是通过使用AdaBoost [4]选择少量重要特征来构建分类器的方法。在任何图像子窗口内，Harr-like特征的总数量非常大，远大于像素数量。为了确保快速分类，学习过程必须排除大部分可用功能，并关注一小组关键功能。受Tieu和Viola工作的启发，特征选择是通过对AdaBoost过程的简单修改实现的：弱学习者受到约束，使得每个弱分类器只能依赖一个特征[17]。因此，选择新的弱分类器的助推过程的每个阶段都可以被视为特征选择过程。 AdaBoost提供了一种有效的学习算法和泛化性能的强大界限[12,7,8]。"

    "The third major contribution of this paper is a method for combining successively more complex classifiers in a cascade structure which dramatically increases the speed of the detector by focussing attention on promising regions of the image. The notion behind focus of attention approaches is that it is often possible to rapidly determine where in an image an object might occur [18, 6, 1]. More complex processing is reserved only for these promising regions. The key measure of such an approach is the “false negative” rate of the attentional process. It must be the case that all, or almost all, object instances are selected by the attentional filter.<br>\n",

In the domain of face detection it is possible to achieve fewer than 1% false negatives and 40% false positives using a classifier which can be evaluated in 20 simple operations (approximately 60 microprocessor instructions). The effect of this filter is to reduce by over one half the number of locations where the final detector must be evaluated.<br>\n",

Unlike steerable filters the only orientations available are vertical and horizontal. It appears as though the set of rectangle features do however provide a rich image representation which supports effective learning. The extreme computational efficiency of rectangle features provides ample compensation for their limited flexibility.<br>\n",

In its original form, the AdaBoost learning algorithm is used to boost the classification performance of a simple learning algorithm (e.g., it might be used to boost the performance of a simple perceptron). It does this by combining a collection of weak classification functions to form a stronger classifier. In the language of boosting the simple learning algorithm is called a weak learner. So, for example the perceptron learning algorithm searches over the set of possible perceptrons and returns the perceptron with the lowest classification error. The learner is called weak because we do not expect even the best classification function to classify the training data well (i.e. for a given problem the best perceptron may only classify the training data correctly 51% of the time). In order for the weak learner to be boosted, it is called upon to solve a sequence of learning problems. After the first round of learning, the examples are re-weighted in order to emphasize those which were incorrectly classified by the previous weak classifier. The final strong classifier takes the form of a perceptron, a weighted combination of weak classifiers followed by a threshold.<br>\n",
    "在我们的系统中，使用AdaBoost的变体来选择特征并训练分类器。在其原始形式中，AdaBoost学习算法用于提高简单学习算法的分类性能（例如，它可以用于提高简单感知器的性能）。它通过组合一组弱分类函数来形成更强的分类器。在提高简单学习算法的语言中被称为弱学习者。因此，例如感知器学习算法搜索可能的感知器集合并返回具有最低分类误差的感知器。学习者被称为弱，因为我们并不期望即使是最好的分类函数也能很好地对训练数据进行分类（即对于给定问题，最好的感知器只能在51％的时间内正确分类训练数据）。为了加强弱势学习者，它被要求解决一系列学习问题。在第一轮学习之后，对这些例子进行重新加权，以强调那些被前一个弱分类器错误分类的例子。最终的强分类器采用感知器的形式，弱分类器的加权组合随后是阈值。\n",

    "The formal guarantees provided by the AdaBoost learning procedure are quite strong. Freund and Schapire proved that the training error of the strong classifier approaches zero exponentially in the number of rounds. More importantly a number of results were later proved about generalization performance [13]. The key insight is that generalization performance is related to the margin of the examples, and that AdaBoost achieves large margins rapidly.<br>\n",

    "The conventional AdaBoost procedure can be easily interpreted as a greedy feature selection process. Consider the general problem of boosting, in which a large set of classification functions are combined using a weighted majority vote. The challenge is to associate a large weight with each good classification function and a smaller weight with poor functions. AdaBoost is an aggressive mechanism for selecting a small set of good classification functions which nevertheless have significant variety. Drawing an analogy between weak classifiers and features, AdaBoost is an effective procedure for searching out a small number of good “features” which nevertheless have significant variety.<br>\n",
    "传统的AdaBoost过程可以很容易地解释为一个贪婪的特征选择过程。考虑助推的一般问题，其中使用加权多数表决将大量分类函数组合在一起。面临的挑战是将一个较大的权重与每个良好的分类功能和一个功能较差的较小权重相关联。 AdaBoost是一种积极的机制，用于选择一小组好的分类函数，但它们有很大的不同。借助弱分类器和特征之间的类比，AdaBoost是一种搜索少量优秀“特征”的有效方法，但它们有很大的不同。\n",

    "One practical method for completing this analogy is to restrict the weak learner to the set of classification functions each of which depend on a single feature. In support of this goal, the weak learning algorithm is designed to select the single rectangle feature which best separates the positive and negative examples (this is similar to the approach of [17] in the domain of image database retrieval). For each feature, the weak learner determines the optimal threshold classification function, such that the minimum number of examples are misclassified. A weak classifier \\\\((h_j(x))\\\\) thus consists of a feature \\\\((f_j)\\\\) a threshold (\\\\(\\Theta_j\\\\)) and a parity (\\ (p_j\\\\)) indicating the direction of the inequality sign:<br>\n",
    "完成这种类比的一种实用方法是将弱学习者限制为依赖于单个特征的一组分类函数。为了支持这一目标，弱学习算法被设计为选择最能区分正面和负面示例的单个矩形特征（这与图像数据库检索领域中的[17]的方法类似）。对于每个特征，弱学习者确定最优阈值分类函数，使得最小数量的例子被错误分类。一个弱分类器\\\\（（h_j（x））\\\\）因此包括一个特征\\\\（（f_j）\\\\）阈值（\\\\（\\ Theta_j \\\\））和一个奇偶校验位（\\（p_j \\\\ ））表明不等号的方向：\n",
